		<p>You have a new neighbor! Someone just moved off the streets into your nearby area and it’s time to party! Make a difference in their lives by throwing them a Welcome Home Party! To get started, simply select “Accept Cause” and it will send the invitation to the rest of your group.</p>
		<p> Before the party, your group is responsible for putting together a <a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/gobethe1-prod/welcome-kit.pdf" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:underline">Welcome Home Kit</a> to make this apartment a HOME! Please be sure your group has a full box ready to go, and it’s Party Time!</p>
